# Rust Cross-Compilation Setup

## Status

✅ **Installed**: `cross` tool for Docker-based cross-compilation  
⏳ **Pending**: Docker Desktop needs to be running

## What Was Done

1. **Installed `cross`** - A Docker-based cross-compilation tool for Rust

   ```bash
   cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
   ```

2. **Updated `rust-cargo-build.sh`** to automatically use `cross` for cross-platform builds

   - Detects when building Linux targets from macOS
   - Detects when building Windows targets from macOS
   - Automatically switches to `cross` instead of `cargo`

3. **Re-enabled cross-compilation** - Changed default back to `CROSS_COMPILE=true`

## Requirements

### Docker Desktop Must Be Running

`cross` requires Docker to work. It uses Docker containers with pre-configured cross-compilation toolchains.

**To start Docker Desktop:**

- Open Docker Desktop application from Applications folder
- Wait for it to fully start (whale icon in menu bar should be active)

**Verify Docker is running:**

```bash
docker ps
```

## Testing Cross-Compilation

Once Docker is running:

```bash
# Test Rust package-e with cross-compilation
cd packages/package-e
bash build.sh

# Should build 6 binaries:
# - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (Linux x64)
# - aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (Linux ARM64)
# - x86_64-apple-darwin (macOS Intel)
# - aarch64-apple-darwin (macOS Apple Silicon)
# - x86_64-pc-windows-gnu (Windows x64)
# - aarch64-pc-windows-gnullvm (Windows ARM64)
```

## Run Full Test Suite

```bash
./test-builds-validation.sh
```

This will:

1. Build all 9 packages
2. Verify expected outputs
3. Check that Rust packages create multiple platform binaries
4. Generate success/failure report

## Expected Results

With `cross` and Docker running:

- **Go (package-g)**: ✅ 6 platforms (native cross-compilation)
- **Rust (package-e, package-i)**: ✅ 6 platforms (using `cross`)
- **Python (package-a, b, c)**: ✅ 1 platform (native only)
- **Java (package-h)**: ✅ 1 JAR (platform-independent)
- **Swift (package-f)**: ✅ 1 universal binary (macOS only)
- **C++ (package-d)**: ✅ 1 platform (native only)

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Running

```bash
# Start Docker Desktop from CLI (macOS)
open -a Docker

# Wait for it to start
for i in {1..30}; do docker ps > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Docker ready" && break || sleep 2; done
```

### Cross Not Found

```bash
# Verify installation
cross --version

# Reinstall if needed
cargo install cross --git https://github.com/cross-rs/cross
```

### Disable Cross-Compilation

If you don't want to use cross-compilation:

```bash
# For individual packages
CROSS_COMPILE=false bash build.sh

# Or edit the script default
# In scripts/build/rust-cargo-build.sh, change:
CROSS_COMPILE="${CROSS_COMPILE:-false}"
```

## Alternative: Native Builds Only

If you don't want to set up Docker and `cross`, Rust will build for the native platform only:

1. Set `CROSS_COMPILE=false` in the script
2. Each Rust package builds 1 binary for the current platform
3. To get all 6 platforms, build on 6 different machines (or use CI/CD)

## CI/CD Note

In GitHub Actions / CI pipelines, `cross` can be used to build all platforms from a single Linux runner, making it very efficient for automated builds.
