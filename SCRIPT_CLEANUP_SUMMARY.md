# Script Cleanup Summary

## Date

18 October 2025

## Actions Taken

### Removed Redundant Scripts

The following test and verification scripts were removed as they have been superseded by the comprehensive `verify-all-builds.sh`:

1. ❌ **`test-all-builds.sh`**

   - Purpose: Basic build testing for all packages
   - Functionality: Sequential building with simple pass/fail reporting
   - Superseded by: `verify-all-builds.sh` Phase 1 & 2

2. ❌ **`test-builds.sh`**

   - Purpose: Individual package build testing with hardcoded paths
   - Functionality: Tests each package separately with timeouts
   - Superseded by: `verify-all-builds.sh` Phase 1 & 2

3. ❌ **`test-cross-compilation.sh`**

   - Purpose: Test cross-compilation features for Go and Rust
   - Functionality: Validates multi-platform builds
   - Superseded by: `verify-all-builds.sh` Phase 3

4. ❌ **`test-builds-validation.sh`**
   - Purpose: Early version of comprehensive validation
   - Functionality: Build validation with Docker testing
   - Superseded by: `verify-all-builds.sh` (complete replacement)

## Remaining Scripts

### Root Level

- ✅ **`build-all.sh`** - Builds all packages
- ✅ **`verify-all-builds.sh`** - Comprehensive verification suite

### Per Package

- ✅ `packages/*/build.sh` - Individual package build scripts

### Build Script Library

- ✅ `scripts/build/python-pyinstaller-build.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/build/go-build.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/build/rust-cargo-build.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/build/cpp-cmake-build.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/build/java-maven-build.sh`
- ✅ `scripts/build/swift-spm-build.sh`

## Benefits

### Before Cleanup

- 6 different test/verification scripts
- Overlapping functionality
- Inconsistent error handling
- Some scripts with `set -e` causing premature exits
- Fragmented testing approach

### After Cleanup

- 2 main scripts (build-all + verify-all)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling
- Graceful failure modes
- Unified comprehensive testing

## verify-all-builds.sh Features

The single comprehensive verification script now includes:

1. **Phase 1**: Build all packages (using `build-all.sh`)
2. **Phase 2**: Validate artifacts (executables, checksums, archives)
3. **Phase 3**: Verify cross-compilation results
4. **Phase 4**: Execute ARM64 macOS binaries
5. **Phase 5**: Execute Linux x86_64 binaries in Docker
6. **Phase 6**: Display summary statistics

### Improvements Made

- ✅ Removed `set -e` for graceful error handling
- ✅ Improved Docker container management
- ✅ Enhanced output capture and display
- ✅ Better cleanup of containers and temp files
- ✅ Continues validation even if some builds fail
- ✅ Extended Linux binary detection (Go + Rust)

## Documentation Updates

Created/Updated:

- ✅ `BUILD_SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide to build and verification scripts
- ✅ `VERIFICATION_SCRIPT_FIXES.md` - Details of fixes applied
- ✅ `SCRIPT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Usage

### Standard Workflow

```bash
# Build and verify everything
./verify-all-builds.sh

# With logging
./verify-all-builds.sh 2>&1 | tee build-all.log

# Just build (no verification)
./build-all.sh

# Build individual package
cd packages/package-name && ./build.sh
```

## Maintenance

Going forward:

- Use `verify-all-builds.sh` for comprehensive testing
- Update only the 2 main scripts and package-level build scripts
- Keep build script library (`scripts/build/*.sh`) as reusable templates
- No need for additional test scripts - everything is in `verify-all-builds.sh`

## Result

✅ **Streamlined from 6 to 2 main scripts**
✅ **All functionality preserved and enhanced**
✅ **Cleaner repository structure**
✅ **Easier maintenance**
✅ **Better documentation**
