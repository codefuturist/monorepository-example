# GitHub Actions Watching - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Added

We've enhanced the automation system with **real-time GitHub Actions workflow monitoring**!

## 🎯 New Features

### 1. Integrated Workflow Watching in Release Scripts

Both `quick-release.sh` and `release-package.sh` now:

- ✅ Offer to watch workflows after pushing to GitHub
- ✅ Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for live status updates
- ✅ Show real-time progress in terminal
- ✅ Provide helpful tips if `gh` is not installed

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/quick-release.sh package-a minor --yes

# After push:
✅ Pushed to GitHub!

🎯 Check GitHub Actions:
   https://github.com/username/repo/actions

🔍 Watch GitHub Actions workflow? [y/N]: y

# Live updates appear! 🎉
```

### 2. Standalone Workflow Monitor Script

New script: `scripts/watch-actions.sh`

**Commands:**
- `watch` - Watch most recent workflow (live updates)
- `list` - List recent workflow runs
- `view` - View workflow details
- `logs` - View workflow logs
- `status` - Show status summary
- `open` - Open GitHub Actions in browser

**Usage:**
```bash
# Watch live
./scripts/watch-actions.sh

# Check status
./scripts/watch-actions.sh status

# List recent runs
./scripts/watch-actions.sh list

# Open in browser
./scripts/watch-actions.sh open
```

### 3. Complete Documentation

Includes:
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
