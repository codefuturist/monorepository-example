# Verification Script Fixes

## Issues Found in `verify-all-builds.sh`

### Problem 1: Script Exiting Prematurely

**Issue**: The script had `set -e` which caused it to exit immediately on any error.

**Impact**:

- Rust builds (package-e, package-i) were marked as "failed" even though they built successfully
- Script exited during Docker testing phase without completing Phase 5 or Phase 6
- No summary statistics were displayed

**Fix**: Removed `set -e` and implemented explicit error checking for each phase.

### Problem 2: Docker Container Conflicts

**Issue**: Docker containers might already exist with the same name, causing failures.

**Fix**: Added explicit cleanup of existing containers before creating new ones:

```bash
docker rm -f "$container_name" 2>/dev/null || true
docker rm -f "${container_name}-v" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Problem 3: Docker Output Not Captured

**Issue**: Docker command output wasn't being captured properly, causing the script to exit.

**Fix**: Wrapped Docker commands in conditional checks and captured exit codes:

```bash
if docker run ... >> /tmp/docker-output-$$.txt 2>&1; then
    result1=0
else
    result1=$?
fi
```

### Problem 4: Build Failures Stopped Execution

**Issue**: `build-all.sh` returns exit code 1 if any package fails, causing the verification script to exit.

**Fix**: Changed error handling to continue validation even if some builds fail:

```bash
if ./build-all.sh 2>&1 | tee /tmp/build-all-verification.log; then
    echo -e "${GREEN}✓${NC} Build process completed"
else
    echo -e "${YELLOW}⚠${NC} Some packages may have had build issues"
    # Continue anyway to validate what was built
fi
```

### Problem 5: Limited Linux Binary Detection

**Issue**: Only detected Rust Linux binaries (`*x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`).

**Fix**: Added detection for Go Linux binaries as well:

```bash
for binary in packages/*/release/*x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu packages/*/release/*x86_64-linux; do
```

### Problem 6: Incomplete Cleanup

**Issue**: Temp files weren't being cleaned up properly in all scenarios.

**Fix**: Enhanced cleanup function to remove all temp files:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/test-binary-* /tmp/docker-output-*.txt /tmp/*-test-$$ 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Changes Made

1. **Removed `set -e`** - Now handles errors gracefully per-phase
2. **Improved Docker container management** - Pre-cleanup and better error handling
3. **Enhanced output capture** - Properly captures and displays Docker output
4. **Continue on build failures** - Validates whatever was built successfully
5. **Better temp file cleanup** - More comprehensive cleanup patterns
6. **Extended Linux binary detection** - Detects both Go and Rust Linux binaries

## Expected Behavior Now

The script will now:

1. Build all packages (continuing even if some fail)
2. Validate all successful build artifacts
3. Check cross-compilation results
4. Execute ARM64 macOS binaries
5. Execute Linux x86_64 binaries in Docker (if Docker is available)
6. Display comprehensive summary statistics
7. Clean up all Docker containers and temp files

Even if some phases have issues, the script will continue and show results for all completed phases.

## Running the Script

```bash
./verify-all-builds.sh 2>&1 | tee build-all.log
```

This will:

- Run the complete verification suite
- Save output to `build-all.log`
- Display real-time progress
- Complete all 6 phases
- Show final summary with statistics
