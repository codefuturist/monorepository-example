# Test Builds Validation Script - Updates

## What Was Changed

The `test-builds-validation.sh` script now includes **Phase 5: Executing ARM64 macOS Binaries**.

### New Functionality

After building and validating all packages, the script now:

1. **Finds all ARM64 macOS binaries** (`*aarch64-apple-darwin`)
2. **Executes each binary** with a 3-second timeout
3. **Captures and displays output** (first 5 lines)
4. **Reports execution status** (success, timeout, or failure)

### Execution Attempts

For each binary, the script tries (in order):

1. `binary --help`
2. `binary --version`
3. `binary` (with no arguments)

### Output Display

```
→ Testing package-name
  Binary: packages/package-name/release/package-name-aarch64-apple-darwin
  ✓ Executed successfully
  Output (first 5 lines):
    [actual output from binary]
```

### Status Codes

- **✓ Success** - Binary executed and exited cleanly (exit code 0)
- **⚠ Timeout** - Binary timed out after 3 seconds (may be interactive or long-running)
- **✗ Failed** - Binary failed to execute (shows exit code and error output)

## Running the Test

```bash
cd /Users/colin/Developer/Projects/personal/monorepository-example
./test-builds-validation.sh
```

The script will:

1. Run `build-all.sh` to build all packages
2. Validate build outputs (files, executables, checksums)
3. **NEW:** Execute each ARM64 macOS binary and show output
4. Generate summary report

## Example Output

```
==========================================
Phase 5: Executing ARM64 macOS Binaries
==========================================

→ Testing package-a
  Binary: packages/package-a/release/package-a-aarch64-apple-darwin
  ✓ Executed successfully
  Output (first 5 lines):
    Package A - Example Application
    Version: 1.0.0
    Usage: package-a [OPTIONS]
    ...

→ Testing package-g
  Binary: packages/package-g/release/package-g-aarch64-apple-darwin
  ✓ Executed successfully
  Output (first 5 lines):
    HTTP Utility v1.0.0
    Commands available:
    - get <url>
    - post <url>
    ...

Execution Results:
  Total binaries tested: 7
  Successful: 7
  Failed: 0
```

## Benefits

1. **Verifies binaries are functional** - Not just compiled, but actually executable
2. **Shows what each binary does** - Captures help/version output
3. **Identifies runtime issues** - Catches execution errors early
4. **Platform-specific testing** - Focuses on native ARM64 macOS binaries

## Packages Tested

Currently tests ARM64 macOS binaries from:

- package-a (Python)
- package-b (Python)
- package-c (Python)
- package-d (C++)
- package-e (Rust)
- package-f (Swift)
- package-g (Go)
- package-i (Rust)

Note: package-h (Java) produces a JAR file, not a native binary, so it's not included in execution tests.
